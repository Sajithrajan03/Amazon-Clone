1. **You**: Check the following code for bugs and provide repair suggestions: 
```javascript
import React, {createContext,useContext,useReducer} from 'react';

export const StateContext = createContext();

export const StateProvider = ({reducer,initialState,children}) =>(
<StateContext.Provider value = {useReducer(reducer,initialState)}> 
{children}
</StateContext.Provider>
);

export const useStateValue = () => useContext(StateContext);


```
